# Glossry for the Ubiquitous Language

## Core domain - Reflection

### Entities

The entities in the core domain:

- Event
  - World event (outside of the circles)
  - Personal event (outer circle)
- Feeling (middle circle)
- Motto (inner circle)
- Source
- Part
  - Year In
  - Year Out

An event is either a World event or a Personal.
A feeling may reference Personal events.
A World event may be referenced by a Source.
There may be only one (or possible maximally two,
I need to think about it) motto per part.
The whole reflection is divided into two Parts:
One for the year that ended (Year In) and
one for the coming year (Year Out).
Year out (obviously) has no world events.
